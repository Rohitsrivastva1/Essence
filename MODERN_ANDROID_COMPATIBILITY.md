# 🔧 Modern Android Compatibility Updates

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Duplicate LAUNCHER Filters**
- **Before**: Both OnboardingActivity and MainActivity had LAUNCHER filters
- **After**: Only OnboardingActivity has LAUNCHER, MainActivity has HOME only
- **Benefit**: Prevents Android confusion about which activity to launch

### 2. **Replaced Deprecated GET_TASKS Permission**
- **Before**: Used `GET_TASKS` permission (deprecated on Android 10+)
- **After**: Uses `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` with `UsageStatsManager`
- **Benefit**: Compatible with modern Android versions and privacy restrictions

### 3. **Updated Immersive Mode for Modern Android**
- **Before**: Used deprecated `systemUiVisibility` for all versions
- **After**: Uses `WindowInsetsController` for API 30+ and legacy methods for older versions
- **Benefit**: Proper immersive mode on Android 11+ with gesture navigation

### 4. **Added UsageStats Permission Handling**
- **New**: Automatic permission request for UsageStats
- **New**: Graceful fallback if permission denied
- **Benefit**: Better analytics and app tracking on modern Android

## 📱 Android Version Compatibility

### ✅ **Android 8.0 - 9.0 (API 26-28)**
- Full immersive mode support
- Traditional navigation buttons
- Complete launcher functionality
- No gesture navigation limitations

### ✅ **Android 10 (API 29)**
- UsageStatsManager support
- Gesture navigation available
- Some gesture limitations apply
- Full launcher functionality

### ⚠️ **Android 11+ (API 30+)**
- Modern WindowInsetsController
- Gesture navigation limitations
- **Note**: Users can exit using system gestures
- This is a system limitation, not a bug

## 🚨 Important Limitations

### **Gesture Navigation on Android 10+**
- **System Limitation**: Users can still exit using system gestures
- **Why**: Android security prevents apps from fully blocking system navigation
- **Workaround**: Users must manually disable gesture navigation in system settings
- **Alternative**: Use traditional navigation buttons for full control

### **UsageStats Permission**
- **Required**: For app usage tracking and analytics
- **User Action**: Must be granted manually in system settings
- **Fallback**: App works without it, but analytics are limited
